# Tropical-Geometry-Sandpile
We study the appearance of Tropical curves in the Abelian Sandpile Model.

# squareiddata
Tropical geometry involves pointwise minima of affine functions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry), called tropical polynomials. 
Associated to tropical polynomials in 2 variables are piecewise linear curves (called tropical curves). Kalinin and Shkolnikov demonstrate (https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06284)
that the Abelian Sandpile Model on a finite square lattice which is in a sense "barely unstable" produces tropical curves which minimize a notion of symplectic area.
This code simulates such sandpile models, with the goal of quantifying the sand that falls off of the square.

# smoothing
This code computes sandpile configurations via the theory of "smoothing" superharmonic functions (see the paper linked above).

# TropicalCurveAlgorithm2
Explores tropical curves passing through certain points in the plane.
